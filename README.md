# TRAILGAME — Trail Manager

Trail-running career management game (beta). Mobile-first, responsive React + TypeScript web app.
See [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for the product and technical specification.

**Current milestone:** M0 — repository foundation (app shell and placeholder screens; no gameplay yet).

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 LTS (see `.nvmrc`; Node ≥ 22.12 also works)
- npm 10+ (npm 11, bundled with Node 24, is recommended)

## Local setup

```bash
npm ci                 # install exact versions from package-lock.json
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional; no variables are used until M2
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

### Testing on a phone

Your phone and computer must be on the same network.

```bash
npm run dev:lan        # dev server, also listening on your LAN IP
# or, for the production build:
npm run build && npm run preview:lan   # http://<your-computer-ip>:4173
```

Vite prints the `Network:` URL to open on the phone.

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server |
| `npm run dev:lan` | Dev server reachable from other devices on your network |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript (strict) project check |
| `npm test` | Unit/component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and build the production bundle into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run check` | Lint, type-check, test and build in sequence |

## Project structure

```text
src/
├── app/          # app shell, routes, navigation config
├── components/   # reusable UI components (Screen, Card, Icon)
├── features/     # route-level screens: dashboard, training, equipment, races, career
├── styles/       # theme tokens (CSS variables) and global styles
└── test/         # test setup
```

Further folders from `DEVELOPMENT.md` §4 (`domain/`, `game-engine/`, `services/`,
`repositories/`, `integrations/`, `supabase/`) are added in the milestone that needs them.

## Deployment — Cloudflare Pages

Not yet connected. To deploy from GitHub:

1. Cloudflare dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git**.
2. Select the `TRAILGAME` repository and the production branch (`main`).
3. Build settings:
   - Framework preset: **React (Vite)** (or None)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`
   - Environment variable: `NODE_VERSION` = `24` (Cloudflare also reads `.nvmrc`)
4. Save and deploy. Every push to `main` deploys to production; other branches get preview URLs.

`public/_redirects` sends all paths to `index.html`, so deep links such as `/races` work after deployment.
No environment variables are required for M0. From M2, add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and
`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in the Pages project settings — never a service-role key.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm ci`, lint, type-check, tests and build on pushes to `main` and on pull requests.
